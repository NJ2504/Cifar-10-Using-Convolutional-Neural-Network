This notebook consists of implementing Convolutional Neural Network and the dataset used is Cifar-10.
The code consists of different variations of Convolutional Neural Network implemented using Tensorflow. 
The different variations include:
1. Different number of convolutional layers, max pooling layers
2. Different number of Dense layers
3. Implementing Dropouts
4. Implementing Padding
5. Visualizing Embeddings
6. Implementation of Xception model.
